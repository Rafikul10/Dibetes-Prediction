# Dibetes-Prediction

# About Model

In this model i created a function for running the model.
after run this function it will be ask to user for few features input such as Age,BMI,BloodPressure etc,
then it will convert this avle into a lsit o numpy array after that it will be scale the all features by 
StandardCaling method and then finally model will predict on that scaling value and will provide the o/p 
in a string like--> [You have diabetes or not]

To train my model i used Pima Indians Diabetes Database from kaggle.
