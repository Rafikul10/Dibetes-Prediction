# Dibetes-Prediction

# About Model

In this model i created a function for running the model.
If you run the function it will be ask to user for few details such as Age,BMI,BloodPressure etc,
then it will convert this avle into a lsit of numpy array after that it will be scale the all features by 
StandardScaling method and then finally model will predict on that scaling value and will provide the o/p 
in a string like--> [You have diabetes or not]

To train my model i used Pima Indians Diabetes Database from kaggle.
