# Dibetes-Prediction

# About Model

In this model after train the data into my model by LogisticRegression algorithm, i created a function for running the model.
If you run the function it will be ask for few details such as Age, BMI, BloodPressure etc,
then it will convert the input into a lsit of numpy array after that it will be scale the all features by 
StandardScaling method and then finally model will predict on that scaling value and will provide the o/p 
in a string like--> [You have diabetes or not]

To train this model i used Pima Indians Diabetes Database from kaggle.
